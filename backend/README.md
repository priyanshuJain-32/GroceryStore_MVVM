
Part 1: To run the application in browser follow these steps:

1. Open terminal and cd into root folder i.e. cd outside this project folder where readme is located and be in the root folder

2. Setup environment and install the dependencies listed in Requirements.txt

3. source environment and activate it

6. Now click on the link in the URL as the port in your system could be different. For me it was http://127.0.0.1:5000/

7. Enjoy the application testing.

Part 2: To test API's follow the steps from 1 to 5 if not done already. After that:

1. Use the yaml file and setup in a tool of your choice which should be installed locally in the system (Faced this issue with Postman online version) or open the project pdf and go to the POSTMAN link given in it again use the installed desktop version.

2. This will allow you to get started with the API's. Make sure to change the last digit in the URL while making the request based on the product or category id.
